> A  **programming language**  is a  [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language")  comprising a set of  [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language#Words_over_an_alphabet "Formal language")  that produce various kinds of  [machine code output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code"). Programming languages are one kind of  [computer language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language "Computer language"), and are used in  [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming")  to implement  [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm").

So I had defined the syntax. means I had created a programming language.

But without an implementation people can't use it. I had created my implementation with JavaScript, the most universal programming language. You can try it here on the [playground](https://unv.vercel.app/playground).

```py
if  5  >  2
    print("Five is greater than two!")  
if  5  >  2
    print("Five is greater than two!")
```
