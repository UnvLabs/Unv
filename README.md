## 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction
We can't use one langauge for everything. Unv is a attempt to make a simple one for this purpose. With simple syntax similar to python , it can be used for any task.

**Here's a taste of UNV :**

```py
import 'print' from 'standard'

if 'Unv is awesome!'
    print('Hello World!')
```
